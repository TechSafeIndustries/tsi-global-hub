## 🎯 KEY CHANGES DELIVERED

### 1. TONE & ENERGY - Bold & Assertive ✓

**The Hook (Hero Section):**
> "Luck isn't a management strategy. When your people, property, and planet are disconnected, you're operating with blind spots. I'm SAI, and I'm here to help you turn fragmented data into a single, audit-ready source of truth."

**SAI's Opening Script:**

**Language:** 100% Australian English ✓

**Visual Prominence:**

  - "Still relying on luck? Let's fix that."
  - "Fragmented systems cost you millions. I can show you where."
  - "Blind spots don't fix themselves. Let's talk."

---

### 3. DIAGNOSTIC FUNNEL - The Hard Questions ✓

**Interactive "Hurt Point Identification" Module**

SAI asks 5 challenging questions:

**Q1:** "Are you operating on fragmented systems or one source of truth?"  
- ⚠️ Fragmented - Multiple tools, spreadsheets, emails
- ✅ Unified - Single integrated platform  
- ❓ Unsure - We might have blind spots

**Q2:** "Is high staff turnover killing your margins?"  
- 📉 Yes - Constant rehiring & retraining costs  
- ⚠️ Somewhat - It's manageable but concerning  
- ✅ No - Retention is strong

**Q3:** "Are you relying on good luck instead of good management?"  
- 🎲 Honestly, yes - Reactive more than proactive  
- ⚠️ Mixed - We have some controls but gaps exist  
- ✅ No - Systematic controls in place

**Q4:** "Can you prove compliance to auditors in real-time?"  
- 📁 No - We scramble for documents before audits  
- ⚠️ Partially - Some records ready, others not  
- ✅ Yes - Full audit trail always accessible

**Q5:** "Do incidents reveal systemic failures or isolated events?"  
- 🔄 Systemic - Same issues keep happening  
- ❓ Unclear - We don't have the data to know  
- ✅ Isolated - We track and prevent recurrence

**Scoring Logic:**
- 4+ critical answers → 🚨 CRITICAL HURT POINTS  
- 2-3 critical → ⚠️ MODERATE RISK  
- 0-1 critical → ✓ LOW RISK - OPTIMISE FURTHER

**Conversion Push:**  
All results drive to:
1. **HSE Business Assessment** (primary CTA)
2. **30-Minute Consultant Booking** (secondary CTA)
